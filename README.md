#Limitations:  

The chat box in the Meetups section is hardcoded for limited responses only. 
For example, 

	for “Sports” on Meetups the sample inputs and their responses are as follows: 

	"Hello"/ “Hi”/ “Hey”: "Hey! How are you?" 

      "I am good. What about you?": "I am good too. Are you a sports enthusiast?" 

	"Yes, big time. How about you?": "Oh totally. I love football.", 

	"We should watch the match today. Are you free?": "Sure why not. I would love to." 

	"Great. Nice to meet you!": "Likewise. Have a good one :)" 

For every other input it will return 

	“I am not programmed for this! Can you try some other messages! 

Company name and Job Title have static values and will not be changed dynamically
